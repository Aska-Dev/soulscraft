# SoulsCraft
`SoulsCraft` is a datapack for Minecraft 1.21 which takes on the gloomy world of the Dark Souls game series by FromSoftware. It brings prominent features like the **ominous bonfire** or famous items from the games into your world.

`SoulsCraft` is designed to be playable with Survival Minecraft and fitted for every Multiplayer experience.

<summary>!!! Warning !!!</summary>
Please take note that this datapack utilizes a technique to create invisible minecarts. This is fundamentally important and the pack wouldn't work without it. Unfortunately this results in difficulties when trying to remove this datapack from a world. All, until that point, placed minecarts will be invisible and not be rendered correctly without the required ressource pack. 

To still remove the datapack from a world safely:
1. Remove the datapack but keep the ressource pack on
2. Replace all important minecarts 
3. Remove the ressource pack 
4. Everything should work normal now

Perhaps I will include a fix via a function in a future version.

# üî• Introduction
## The Bonfire
A core component of the `SoulsCraft Datapack` is the new station: **The Bonfire**.

To create a new bonfire combine a campfire and an iron sword on the floor.

## Bonfire Mechanics

Resting at a bonfire will heal you back to full life and set your spawn point at the bonfire you last rested at. Additionally you will recieve a **Soul** from time to time.

<summary>Linking items</summary>

Using the power of the kindled flame you may **link** ressources together to discover new items and equipment.

To **link** items just place them into the *three ressource slots* left to the green arrow at the **Linking Menu**. As soon as you put in a valid combination of ressources, the order of the items are irrelevant, the ressources will be consumed and to the right of the green arrow a new item will appear. 

Please be aware that the crafting is not 100% precise and will consume MORE ressources than needed if you put in more. Until this point the linking mechanic does not support noticing if more ressources are put in and cannot handle giving out more than one result item.

### Collecting Souls
From time to time when you rest at a bonfire you will notice that you got a **Soul of a Lost Undead**. When you kill mobs and enemies you will gather souls shards unknowingly! Everytime you have enough to form a whole soul you will recieve one at your next rest at a bonfire.

But be careful! Everytime you die, you will lose all your soul shards. 

# üîú Hopes and Dreams: Plans for the future
The `SoulsCraft-Datapack` seems quite small at the moment, yet a lot of features are already partially implemented and just wait for completion! 

You can look out for new features like a **levelup system** to use abilities and custom weapons. Some **custom structures** to explore and fight well-known enemies from the Dark Souls Games and much more.
